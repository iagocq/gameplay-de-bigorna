## Features

- See the steps required to get the green slider to the red slider while respecting the forging constraints
  - The program has an algorithm that tries to take close to the optimal number of steps to get you to the goal, so you should have Perfectly Forged items most of the time!
- Paste a screenshot of the in-game anvil interface to automatically set up the red and green sliders
  - Try to contain the screenshot to the inventory region to avoid failures in detection
- Set constraints by clicking on the empty space at the top
- Perform forging steps by clicking on the red and green buttons
- Move the red and green sliders freely
- Set special constraints (Not Last, Any) by clicking on the orange/green indicators (the things with 3 thin rows between the expected steps and the last performed steps)
